#### About me
My experience with IT began as a recruitment manager at MTS IT. I was bored in recruitment. When I had more time, I started learning the basics of SQL. In the autumn of 2022, I started learning HTML and CSS. I became interested in frontend development.

My goal is to become a frontend developer in 2022 and get my first job as a developer. I plan to learn JavaScript and at least one framework (Angular\React). 

My strongest qualities are a love of learning. Ability to overcome challenges and understand complex topics. I am motivated to see the result of my work.
